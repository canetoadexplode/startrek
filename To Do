# To Do

## Easy
* Menu text
  * fast scroll with end of line pause
  * when you choose a menu option, your choice prints (ex. You look to the left, you see __)

## Not Easy
* Create a transporter room, can move you to any room
  * Maybe only rooms you've been to so far? 
  * Maybe it malfunctions and sends you random places sometimes/all the time
* Borg fighting and consequences
  * If you leave a room with a borg in it without killing the borg, you die
  * Amount of borg increase per turns?

## Over Ambitious 
* Create different locations for the key. Randomize per game
